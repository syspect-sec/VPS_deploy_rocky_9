# Instructions: Each record should be formatted as the sample below.
# <file> specifies in the directory and <dir> will change permissions on directory.
# Lines that start with '#' will be ignored
# SELinux permissions need to be adjusted for Centos.
# Apache needs special read or write permissions.
# These are handled with <se-dir-read> and <se-dir-read-write>
# Examples:
# Sample 1: 440 on all files recursively in directory path /var/www/
# <file> -R 440 /var/www/html/
# Sample 2: 770 on only a single directory
# <dir> 770 /var/www/html/<default_github_reponame>/uploads/
# Sample 3: recursive read for SELinux on the entire web-application directory
# <se-dir-read> -R /var/www/html/<default_github_reponame>/
# Sample 4: read write permissions on a specific directory
# <se-dir-read-write> /var/www/html/<default_github_reponame>/logs/
# All files in the web-root directory get written with Apache read only
<file> -R  0707 /var/www/html/<default_github_reponame>/
